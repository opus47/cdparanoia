.TH CDPARANOIA 1 "11 Sep 2008"
.SH NAME
cdparanoia (version 10.2) \- an audio CD reading utility which includes extra data verification features
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cdparanoia
.RB [ options ]
.B span 
.RB [ outfile ]
.RB | \-B
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cdparanoia
retrieves audio tracks from CDDA-capable CDROM drives.  The data can
be saved to a file or directed to standard output in WAV, AIFF, AIFF-C
or raw format.  Most ATAPI, SCSI, and several proprietary CDROM drive
makes are supported;
.B cdparanoia
can determine if the target drive is CDDA capable.
.P
In addition to simple reading, 
.B cdparanoia
adds extra-robust data verification, synchronization, error handling
and scratch reconstruction capability.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP 
.B \-A --analyze-drive
Run and log a complete analysis of drive caching, timing and reading behavior;
verifies that cdparanoia is correctly modelling a specific drive's cache and
read behavior. Implies -vQL.

.TP
.B \-v --verbose
Be absurdly verbose about the autosensing and reading process. Good
for setup and debugging.

.TP
.B \-q --quiet
Do not print any progress or error information during the reading process.

.TP
.B \-e --stderr-progress
Force output of progress information to stderr (for wrapper scripts).

.TP
.B \-l --log-summary [file]
Save result summary to file, default filename cdparanoia.log.

.TP
.B \-L --log-debug [file]
Save detailed device autosense and debugging output to a file, default filename cdparanoia.log.

.TP
.B \-V --version
Print the program version and quit.

.TP
.B \-Q --query
Perform CDROM drive autosense, query and print the CDROM table of
contents, then quit.

.TP
.B \-s --search-for-drive
Forces a complete search for a CDROM drive, even if the /dev/cdrom link exists.

.TP
.B \-h --help
Print a brief synopsis of 
.B cdparanoia 
usage and options.

.TP
.B \-p --output-raw
Output headerless data as raw 16-bit PCM data with interleaved samples in host byte order.  To force little or big endian byte order, use
.B \-r 
or 
.B \-R
as described below.

.TP
.B \-r --output-raw-little-endian
Output headerless data as raw 16-bit PCM data with interleaved samples in LSB first byte order.

.TP
.B \-R --output-raw-big-endian
Output headerless data as raw 16-bit PCM data with interleaved samples in MSB first byte order.

.TP
.B \-w --output-wav
Output data in Micro$oft RIFF WAV format (note that WAV data is always
LSB-first byte order).

.TP
.B \-f --output-aiff
Output data in Apple AIFF format (note that AIFC data is
always in MSB-first byte order).

.TP
.B \-a --output-aifc
Output data in uncompressed Apple AIFF-C format (note that AIFF-C data is
always in MSB-first byte order).

.TP
.BI "\-B --batch "

Cdda2wav-style batch output flag;
.B cdparanoia
will split the output
into multiple files at track boundaries.  Output file names are
prepended with 'track#.'

.TP
.B \-c --force-cdrom-little-endian
Some CDROM drives misreport their endianness (or do not report it at
all); it's possible that
.B cdparanoia
will guess incorrectly.  Use
.B \-c
to force
.B cdparanoia
to treat the drive as a little endian device.

.TP
.B \-C --force-cdrom-big-endian
As above but force cdparanoia to treat the drive as a big endian device.

.TP
.BI "\-n --force-default-sectors " n
Force the interface backend to do atomic reads of 
.B n
sectors per read.  This number can be misleading; the kernel will often
split read requests into multiple atomic reads (the automated Paranoia
code is aware of this) or allow reads only within a restricted size
range. 
.B This option should generally not be used.

.TP
.BI "\-d --force-cdrom-device " device
Force the interface backend to read from
.B device
rather than the first readable CDROM drive it finds.  This can be used
to specify devices of any valid interface type (ATAPI, SCSI, or
proprietary).

.TP
.BI "\-k --force-cooked-device " device
This option forces use of the old 'cooked ioctl' kernel 
interface with the specified CDROM device.  The cooked ioctl interface
is obsolete in Linux 2.6 if it is present at all.  
.B \-k 
cannot be used 
with
.B \-d 
or 
.BR \-g .


.TP
.BI "\-g --force-generic-device " device
This option forces use of the old 'generic SCSI' (sg) kernel
interface with the specified generic SCSI device.
.B \-g 
cannot be used with
.BR \-k .
.B \-g
may be used with
.B \-d
to explicitly set both the SCSI cdrom and
generic (sg) devices separately. This option is only useful on
obsolete SCSI setups and when using the generic SCSI (sg) driver.

.TP
.BI "\-S --force-read-speed " number
Use this option explicitly to set the read rate of the CD drive (where
supported).  This can reduce underruns on machines that have slow disks, or
which are low on memory.

.TP
.BI "\-t --toc-offset " number
Use this option to force the entire disc LBA addressing to shift by
the given amount; the value is added to the beginning offsets in the
TOC.  This can be used to shift track boundaries for the whole disc
manually on sector granularity.  The next option does something
similar...

.TP
.BI "\-T --toc-bias "
Some drives (usually random Toshibas) report the actual track
beginning offset values in the TOC, but then treat the beginning of
track 1 index 1 as sector 0 for all read operations.  This results in
every track seeming to start too late (losing a bit of the beginning
and catching a bit of the next track).
.B \-T
accounts for this behavior.  Note that this option will cause
.B cdparanoia
to attempt to read sectors before or past the known user
data area of the disc, resulting in read errors at disc edges on most
drives and possibly even hard lockups on some buggy hardware.

.TP
.BI "\-O --sample-offset " number
Use this option to force the entire disc to shift sample position
output by the given amount; this can be used to shift track boundaries
for the whole disc manually on sample granularity. Note that this will
cause
.B cdparanoia
to attempt to read partial sectors before or past the
known user data area of the disc, probably causing read errors on most
drives and possibly even hard lockups on some buggy hardware.


.TP
.B \-Z --disable-paranoia
Disable 
.B all
data verification and correction features.  When using -Z,
.B cdparanoia
reads data exactly as would
.BR cdda2wav (1)
with an overlap setting of zero.
This option implies that 
.B \-Y
is active.

.TP
.B \-z --never-skip[=max_retries]
Do not accept any skips; retry forever if needed.  An optional maximum
number of retries can be specified; for comparison, default without
.B -z
is
currently 20.

.TP
.B \-Y --disable-extra-paranoia
Disables intra-read data verification; only overlap checking at read
boundaries is performed. It can wedge if errors occur in the attempted overlap area. Not recommended.

.TP
.B \-X --abort-on-skip
If the read skips due to imperfect data, a scratch, or whatever, abort reading this track.  If output is to a file, delete the partially completed file.

.SH SPAN ARGUMENT

The span argument specifies which track, tracks, or subsections of
tracks to read.  This argument is required,
unless batch-mode is used (in batch-mode, cdparanoia will rip all tracks if no span is given).
.B NOTE:
Unless the span is a simple number, it's generally a good idea to
quote the span argument to protect it from the shell.
.P
The span argument may be a simple track number or an offset/span
specification.  The syntax of an offset/span takes the rough form:
.P
1[ww:xx:yy.zz]-2[aa:bb:cc.dd] 
.P
Here, 1 and 2 are track numbers; the numbers in brackets provide a
finer-grained offset within a particular track. [aa:bb:cc.dd] is in
hours/minutes/seconds/sectors format. Zero fields need not be
specified: [::20], [:20], [20], [20.], etc, would be interpreted as
twenty seconds, [10:] would be ten minutes, [.30] would be thirty
sectors (75 sectors per second).
.P
When only a single offset is supplied, it is interpreted as a starting
offset and ripping will continue to the end of the track.  If a single
offset is preceded or followed by a hyphen, the implicit missing
offset is taken to be the start or end of the disc, respectively. Thus:

.TP
.B  1:[20.35]    
Specifies ripping from track 1, second 20, sector 35 to the end of
track 1.
.TP
.B 1:[20.35]-   
Specifies ripping from 1[20.35] to the end of the disc
.TP
.B \-2           
Specifies ripping from the beginning of the disc up to (and including) track 2
.TP
.B \-2:[30.35]   
Specifies ripping from the beginning of the disc up to 2:[30.35]
.TP
.B 2-4          
Specifies ripping from the beginning of track 2 to the end of track 4.
.P
Again, don't forget to protect square brackets and preceding hyphens from
the shell.

.SH EXAMPLES

A few examples, protected from the shell:
.TP
Query only with exhaustive search for a drive and full reporting of autosense:
.P
       cdparanoia -vsQ
.TP
Extract an entire disc, putting each track in a separate file:
.P
       cdparanoia -B 
.TP
Extract from track 1, time 0:30.12 to 1:10.00:
.P
       cdparanoia "1[:30.12]-1[1:10]"
.TP
Extract from the beginning of the disc through track 3:
.P
       cdparanoia -- -3
.TP
The "--" above is to distinguish "-3" from an option flag.
.SH OUTPUT

The output file argument is optional; if it is not specified,
.B cdparanoia
will output samples to one of
.BR cdda.wav ", " cdda.aifc ", or " cdda.raw
depending on whether 
.BR \-w ", " \-a ", " \-r ", or " \-R " is used (" \-w
is the implicit default).  The output file argument of 
.B \-
specifies standard output; all data formats may be piped.
